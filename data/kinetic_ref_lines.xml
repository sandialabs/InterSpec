<!-- This file defines the "kinetic" Reference Photopeak lines (i.e., the lines that change as
    you use move the mouse, when the feature is turned on) that are always possibilities.
    You can copy this file to InterSpecs user data directory (See Help -> Data for this 
    location, but usually on Windows its 'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\InterSpec'
    and on macOS '/Users/username/Library/Containers/gov.sandia.macOS.InterSpec/Data/Library/Application Support/sandia.InterSpec')
    and then modify it, and your custom definitions will be what are always used.
    If you modify this file, or add it to your user data directory, you must restart
    InterSpec for the changes to take effect.

    For syntax, possibilities, and examples of what you can input into this file, see
    "data/add_ref_line.xml" in the InterSpec app distribution, or at https://github.com/sandialabs/InterSpec/blob/master/data/add_ref_line.xml
    
    Currently you can define two source type:
    1) SourceLines: this is simple energy and branching ratio pairs.  
    2) NucMixture:  this is a mixture of nuclides, at a specified relative 
                    activities to each other.

        <!-- You can put multiple lines in a source, as well as specify additional infomation like: -->
        <!--  <Line nuc="F18" color="rgb(14,196,69)" info="" atten="false">510.998910 1.0</Line> -->
    </SourceLines>

    <!-- Individual sources are just single nuclides, reactions or x-ray elements.
    You can specify:
      - age: via "default-age" attribute (if you dont specify, then InterSpec will determine default age), 
      - color: "color" attribute with a valid CSS color string (if you dont specify, the  color is determined by Color Theme), 
      - Shielding material and thickness: "shield-material" and "shield-thickness".  The material must be like you a shielding widget in InterSpec displays, or it can specify a generic shielding, for example a value "AN=26, AD=7.874".  Thickness is specified like you would enter into InterSpec
      - if background: "is-background", (currently unimplemented) if true, source will be treated as a trace source in soil, and transported to the surface
      - weight: A floating point number that affects how likely the lines for this source are to be shown.  This number is multiplied by a windowed weighting, to help decide which set of lines to show.  The higher this number, the more likely it is to be shown.  A value of 1 is default for this file, already-identified isotopes (e.g., peaks with an associated source) get a weight of 10, exteran RID isotopes 5, on-board-RID 2.5, etc
