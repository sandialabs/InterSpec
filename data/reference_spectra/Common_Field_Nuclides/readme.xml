<h3>Common Field Nuclide Reference Spectra</h3>

<p>The spectra in this collection represent commonly encountered field nuclides, for a variety of handheld detectors.</p>

<p>The spectra were all simulated using GADRAS v19, from inject definitions created by Michael Enhauser (org 06634) of Sandia National Laboratories.
There are 223 inject source definitions, each simulated with a live time of 1800 seconds, and with a nominal background in Livermore California.
