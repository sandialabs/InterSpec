  <Tool name="detected_peaks">
    <Description>Returns all Regions Of Interest (ROI) with peaks detected by automated peak search. For ROI gives lower and upper energies, and for each peak it gives energy (in keV), FWHM, amplitude (area), and statistical significance (numSigma); if the peak is associated with a source, will also give information on that.

    <Description>Searches for radiation sources (nuclides, x-rays, reactions) that have gammas, x-rays, alphas, and/or beta-end-point at specified energies. Returns candidate sources ranked by how well they match the input energies and current foreground spectrum.

It is best to only search on a single energy at a time, and only for foreground peaks whose source is not identified; do not search on multiple energies unless you are investigating or suspect they are from the same source, or are really having a hard time identifying a source.

The 'profile_score' metric (larger = better match) is the best indicator of fit quality for the loaded spectrum, considering peak heights and detector response.

Further investigation of top returned candidates is required to make sure they match the spectrum (e.g., the spectrum is not missing a peak it should have from that source, or the peaks in the spectrum have expected relative amplitudes, etc.)</Description>

Returns decision threshold, detection limit, and confidence intervals - as well as if it looks like a peak is at the energy (see `peakPresentInData` in output).</Description>

  <Tool name="photopeak_detection_efficiency">
    <Description>Given an array of source photon energies, returns the fraction of photons that will contribute to a peak in data. The returned answer will include the attenuation factor of shielding (if specified), the fraction of photons making it to the detector (if distance is specified), the detection probability of photons that are incident upon the detector (i.e., the intrinsic detection efficiency) if a detector efficiency function is loaded (use 'detector_efficiency_function_info' tool call with no arguments to see if a detector efficiency function is loaded, and 'avaiable_detector_efficiency_functions' and 'load_detector_efficiency_function' to load an efficiency function), and gives total detection probability.</Description>
