  /** Fits the peaks in an 'exemplar' file, in a number of other similar file.
   A work in progress.
   
   Currently the results aren't too great, could use:
   - Limits, that are maybe adjustable, for how significant a peak has to be, before it is kept
   - The FWHM needs to be enforced to be reasonable - like after fitting the peaks, fit the FWHM, and then constrain the FWHM to be
      something reasonable around that (hopefully the higher-statistics peaks will dominate the FWHM - or instead could do auto
      peak search, and use those to get the FWHM - this is probably the better idea - or maybe some combination)
   - The FWHM within a single ROI should be constrained
   
   TODO:
   - specify a struct that contains all the options for the fit - we will likely be adding more options, like statistical significance
   - have a .ini file able to back the command line options, so users can specify their own default options
   - When peaks are not fit for, print out their Currie detection limit
