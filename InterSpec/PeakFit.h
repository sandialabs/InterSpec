 This function is necassary when fitting new peaks that even though the PeakDef objects themselves
 get copied, so the original input peaks wont be modified, we need to make sure the continuum itself
 wont get modified as well.  The PeakDef tracks its continuum as a shared pointer, that may be
 shared by several PeakDefs, and if you copy a PeakDef, the pointer is just dumbly copied, meaning
 if you modify the continuum of a copied PeakDef, the continuum of the original PeakDef is also
 modified since they are the same object in memory.
 This is a poor design.  The continuum should own the PeakDef, not the other way around, but this
