  /** \brief Compute the human dose in Seiverts based on radiation leakage and
   the distance from the source.
   
   The fluence-to-dose functions were taken from ANSI/ANS-6.1.1-1991 polynomial
   fits for the most conservative case: Anterior-Posterior orientation, Table 5 
   and Table 6. In this program the average fluence-to-dose factor for an energy 
   interval is taken to be the fluence-to-dose value of the average energy of 
   the interval.
   
   Adapted from GADRAS code iGetDose.f, routine IGETDOSE.
   
   \param energies Energies of incomming gammas in keV.
   \param intensity Intensities of cooresponding gammas. A weight of 1 equals
          1 source gama, before shielding.
   \param areal_density Areal density, in units of PhysicalUnits (e.g. would
          have to divide by g/cm2 to print out g/cm2) of shielding
   \param atomic_number Atomic numberof the shielding
   \param distance Distance from center of source to location of interest
   \param scatter The GadrasScatterTable object to use to create the continuum
   
   \returns Returns dose in units of PhysicalUnits.  That is, to convert
            into a human readable dose at a given distance, you would divide
            by PhysicalUnits::sievert/PhysicalUnits::hour to give sv/hr.
