   Surprisingly, the erf() function is the major bottleneck for peak fitting.
   
   20191230: wcjohns extracted the boost::math::erf() function implementation
   from boost 1.65.1 for double precision (53 bit mantissa) into this function,
   boost_erf_imp(). Removing some of the supporting code structure, and
   explicitly writing out the polynomial equation evaluation, and removing some
   very minor corrections, seems to speed things up by about a factor of ~3 over
   calling boost::math::erf() (and agrees with boosts implementation to within
   1E-10%, across the entire range).
   
   In the implementation file, there is a commented out erf_approx() function looks to be about 25% faster than
   this boost version, but I havent carefully checked out the precision implications
   so not switching to it yet.

   @param sigma The peak width
   @param alpha_left The left-sided Crystal Ball skew of the peak
   @param n_left The left-sided Crystal Ball power-law of the peak
   @param alpha_right The right-sided Crystal Ball skew of the peak
   @param n_right The right-sided Crystal Ball power-law of the peak
   @param The fraction of the distribution you want to be outside of the returned range; must
          be between 1.0E-11and 0.999.
   
   @returns limits so that `0.5*p` of the distribution will be below the first element, and
   `0.5*p` will be above the second element, so the fraction of the distribution between the
   returned limits is `1 - p`.
   
   The area below the retuned limit should be quite accurate, while above may only be good to within 0.02 of requested area (i.e. `0.02*p`).
   
   TODO: currently, the upper limit is found via iteration - should fix math so it can analytically be found, like lower limit
   
   Throws error on invalid input - or if limit cant be found (which can happen for really larger skews).

    /** 20231109: Currently `DSCB_pdf_non_norm` yields a that can be almost 20% too low, over the entire effective range
     I'm totally not sure why - it could be an error in my integration for normalization, a bug in the indefinite integral functions,
     or likely a mis-understanding on my part, or a bug in `DSCB_pdf_non_norm` that I have just become blind to seeing.
     So for the moment, we wont use the equivalent of `DSCB_pdf_non_norm` in the JS, which is faster and more compact,
     see test\_PeakDists.cpp for some commented out tests that show this issue.  I'm a bit miffed at this inconsistency.
