 TODO items:
 - Have the SpecMeas hold the history for itself
 - Make it so this class collects all the undo/redo steps for a given event loop, and mark this object as needing update, so
   during render, all steps are collected up, and made into a single step - but this would require making this class inherit
   from Wt::WWidget (or more likely Wt::WCompositeWidget), instead of just Wt::WObject - or hooking into this class from
   `InterSpecApp::notify(...)` (but I am assuming all updating/rendering happens from within `notify`, which I'm 100% on)
 - `canAddUndoRedoNow()` and similar could also instead reference a variable that is not reset until the end of
   `InterSpecApp::notify(...)`, so objects that set undo/redo steps during `render(...)`, will properly be able
   to detect if they should add a step or not (particularly from within `addUndoRedoStep(...)`)

   If the user has "undo" one or more times, then the undo/redo functions of the undid steps will swapped and new
   steps added to the stack, and the new undo/redo step is then placed on the stack after these.
   
   You can pass in nullptr function for undo or redo; if you do this, then this step will be skipped over for the relevant
   undo/redo step.  This is so you can use "undo" to close an one-off dialog, and not specify a redo, and then later on
   there wont be a seeming empty redo step later on (although, depending if use use WApplication::bind(...) to close a
   specific window, the undo slot will seem empty to the user).
   
   If you are currently executing an undo or redo step, the new step passed in will not be added.
   
   Be careful of:
   - If you capture any shared pointers, particularly to SpecMeas objects, keep in mind you could create dependency
      cycles that could cause the object to never destruct, even if all other shared pointers are gone.  Using std::weak_ptr<SpecMeas>
      can help with this.
