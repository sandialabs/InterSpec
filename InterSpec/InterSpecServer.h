  /** Add a session token to be tracked or allowed.
   
   Session tokens are given as part of the url using the key 'apptoken' or 'externalid', and are used to interact with a specific session
   being displayed in a particular browser tab, or WebView, or whatever, programmatically through the c++.
   An example of adding a token to a url would be: "http://localhost:8080?apptoken=23324assd1&restore=no&..."
      
   By default any token, or no token at all are required, but you can change this by calling #set_require_tokened_sessions, but if you do,
   then you you also need to call #add_allowed_session_token with a particular token _before_ a session with that token in the URL
   can be loaded.  If you dont restrict requiring tokens, then the status of sessions with tokens that you have not called
   #add_allowed_session_token for will not be tracked, but the InterSpecApp class will still keep these tokens so that you can interact
   with individual sessions.
   
   @Returns:
   - 0 if hadnt been seen before
   - 1 if authorized but not seen yet
   - 2 if authorized and loaded
   -3 if deauthorized session
   - 4 if dead session
   
   if session had been seen before (e.g., non-zero return value), no changes will be made to that sessions allowed state.
