 channels for orig_cal<==>other_cal, then the returned answer gives new_cal<==>answer.
 
 This function is useful when performing energy calibrations on files that have multiple detectors
 with different energy calibrations.
 
 The reason this is a non-trivial operation is that when you perform a a change in energy
 calibration to one spectrum, and expect a second spectrum with a different starting energy
 calibration (maybe higher-order, or more/less-quadratic, etc) to behave similarly (e.g., a peak at
 626 keV in both spectra to begin with, should end up at 661 keV after the change), what you need to
 do is ensure the relative channels stay fixed to each other (e.x., channel 5 of spectrum 1 may
 correspond to same energy as channel 19.3 of spectrum two, while channel 1024 of spectrum 1
 corresponds to the same energy of channel 999 of spectrum two, etc).  That is what this function
 does.
 
 Throws exception if any input #SpecUtils::EnergyCalibration is null, invalid, or if 'orig_cal'
 or 'new_cal' are not polynomial or full range fraction, or if applying the difference causes
 'other_cal' to become invalid.
 
 @returns a valid #SpecUtils::EnergyCalibration pointer that is the same calibration type, and same
          number of channels as 'other_cal'.
