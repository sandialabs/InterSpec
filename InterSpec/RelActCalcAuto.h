 Further things to consider:
 - For the relative efficiency chart, currently all markers for peaks info fall exactly on the
    RelEff line. What we should do is, after finding the solution, cluster the peaks together
    (similar to Act/Shield fit), and then make a template for each clustered peak (sum all peaks into
    a channel count array, with separate array for each clustered peak), with some threshold (like
    99% detection threshold) that if the clustered peaks area is less than, it just gets subtracted
    from the data, unless its the only peak for that ROI.
    Then fit the templates to data, and use the fit values to make the markers on the RelEff plot.
    I think the plotting JS can handle showing info for multiple nuclides in a single plots
    mouse-over.  We will need to create new variable that is analogous to
    #RelActAutoSolution::m_fit_peaks, but maps multiple source nuclides to a single peak.
 - Sum peaks - not totally sure how to handle - can there just be one parameter that controls
    strength of peak random summing, and then another for cascade?  For cascades we dont have
    gamma-x-ray coincidences (or is it the case we can just assume constant fraction between any
    gamma and any nuclide?), so we might need two parameters, one for gamams, one for gamma-neutrons
    and I guess maybe xray-xray?
