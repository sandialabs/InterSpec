 ToDo:
 -Allow specifying peak fill and line colors seperately.
 -Allow user to pick alpha (now that spectrum.js can be used) for chart things.
 
 Note: Alpha channel is not supported currently, due to issue with Wt<4.0.4
 https://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/6702
 (could implement a workaround for now...)
