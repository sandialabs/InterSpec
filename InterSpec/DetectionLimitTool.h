/** TODO:
 - [x] Every update seems to trigger a layout resize that causes the chart to grow.
 - [ ] The MdaPeakRow (i.e., each gamma) should probably be like a WPanel that has just the "Use for Likilihood" checkbox in the title, as well as the currie MDA summary text, but then can be expanded to show the other settings
 - [ ] Could allow entering a scale factor for spectrum; this is like you have a 5 minute background, but are interested in a 60s dwell
 - [ ] Have a little pop-up window or something that gives full information for Curie calculation
 - [ ] Add in a Curie style MDA calculator where you enter limits, BR, and stuff and get out counts and such
 - [ ] The likelihood based estimate does not seem to be reliable yet
 - [x] Add in checkbox to allow accounting for attenuation in the air (or just always do this)
 - [x] Add in allowing to calculate the maximum detection distance; not sure if this should be individual peaks, or all peaks; maybe a toggle for the whole screen
 - [x] Add a drop-box to allow selecting confidence for limit (e.g., 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, etc)
 - [ ] Allow asserting you know there isnt a peak in the spectrum, and affix the peak continuums to the observed spectrum
 - [x] Allow adjusting the simple MDA side-widths
 - [ ] Allow fitting for energy calibration, or accounting for it anyway
 - [ ] If spectrum already has a peak defined for a gamma, re-use its definition of roi lower and upper energies
 - [ ] When deconvolution method is used along with continuum determined from channels above/below the ROI, need to probably take into account the stat uncertainty of the channels...
 - [ ] Check numerical accuracies of calculations
 - [ ] Report mass as well as activity
 - [ ] Make sure when presence is reported on Currie style limit (e.g., both lower and upper limits given), the coverage is actually correct; e.g. 95% of times in given interval, and not 97.5% or 90% or something.
 - [ ] Allow volumetric sources; either trace or self-attenuating.
 - [ ] Add in pass-by (e.g., at a fixed speed/distance) calculation
  - [ ] Have C-api to call from node/python
 
 - [x] Switch to using  a CSS grid layout for the options section
 - [x] put in BR (after DRF and shield) to limit total number of peaks; have it be zero by default if less than 10 peaks, or 0.1 or something otherwise
 - probably also filter lines that have essentually a zero efficiency per bq
 - [ ] Make a "by eye" equivalent CL
 
 - [ ] Make test cases that will quickly iterate through, to test things
 - [ ] Give the user a choice about using continuum fixed at null hypothesis
 - [ ] For each row show plot of current peak in that row
 - [ ] Allow combining ROI with neighboring peaks
    - Actually should just include all gammas in an energy range, and have them all share a continuum - so a user could widen the ROI to include multiple peaks, and all would be fine
 - [ ] In addition to error messages, have an area for warning messages (like if scaling spectrum more than 1.0, etc)
 - [ ] Allow user to pick Currie limit ranges, and improve clarity of this stuff, like maybe have each peak be a WPanel or something
 - [ ] Have the energy rows fold down to show more information, similar to Steves tool, for each energy
 - [ ] If user clicks on a result row, have chart zoom to that general region
 
 - [ ] Allow minor gamma-lines overlapping with primary gamma lines to contribute to peak area
 - [ ] Allow users to double click on the spectrum to add a peak to the limit, or similarly for erasing a peak
 - [ ] Remember ROI properties for all user changed ROIs, for full use, not just if nuclide changes
 
 - [x] Make the Chi2 plot a D3 based plot
 - [x] Put the Chi2 chart to the right of the spectrum, when it should exist
 - [x] Make it so when user change ROI on chart, it updates the text input
 - [x] Add in allowing to age nuclide (didnt I generalize inputting a nuclide somewhere?  Hopefully just re-use that)
 - [x] Default fill in reference lines/shielding/age as user has in Reference PhotoPeak tool
