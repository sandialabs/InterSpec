         In order to save the alterations you made to a spectrum file that occurred during calibration,
         <u>navigate</u>
         to the
         <b>Interspec &#8594; Save As</b>;
this will save the entire InterSpec state (includes current spectra) to the database under your specified name/description which you can restore back to at a later time.  To save any changes in the future, <u>select</u> <b>InterSpec  &#8594; Save</b> which will overwrite the save data.  This is known as the HEAD, and will always contain the latest changes.   </div>
