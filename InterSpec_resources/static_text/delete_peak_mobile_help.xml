<p>
The easiest way to delete a peaks is to hold your finger down on it for about a second, 
and menu will pop where you can choose to delete the peak.

</div>
</p>


<p>
You can also place two fingers that span the energy range of peaks you want to delete, onto the screen, and move them up.
Any peaks with centroids between your fingers will be completely removed; you can also reduce the energy range of peaks
using this same gesture, as long as the peaks centroid doesnt fall between your fingers.

<p>The <em>Peak Manager</em> (<b>Menu</b>&rarr;<b>Tools</b>&rarr;<b>Peak Manager</b>) and <em>Peak Editor</em> (hold finger on peak for one second, select <b>Peak Editor</b>) can also delete peaks.</p>
