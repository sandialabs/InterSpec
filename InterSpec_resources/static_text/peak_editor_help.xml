      <div>This tool allows you to have fine grained control over peak parameters
by either directly specifying the parameters, or by specifying which parameters
should be fit for, and then re-fitting the peak.  The <b>Peak Editor</b> also allows
you to edit the nuclide associated with this peak, or change the continuum type
used for the peak.</div>
      <div style="padding-top: 10px">
         To access the <b>Peak Editor</b> dialog,
         <!-- <u>right-click</u> -->
tap and hold for about a second,
         within the region of
interest (ROI) of an identified peak, and then
         <u>select</u>
         &#34;<b>Peak Editor</b>&#34;:

If you have multiple peaks next to each other sharing a ROI, the peak
nearest where you <u>right-clicked</u> is chosen; while the <b>Peak Editor</b> window is

         a new peak and

         the

<h3>Peak Skew Descriptions</h3>
There are currently three skew distributions that modify the lower energy tail of Gaussian peaks,
and two skew distributions that modify both the lower and upper energy tails of the Gaussians.

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Exp*Gauss</b>: Convolution of Gaussian with an left-hand exponential multiplied by a
    step function that goes to zero above the peak mean.<br />
    See:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analytical function for fitting peaks in alpha-particle spectra from Si detectors<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation. Part A. Applied Radiation and Isotopes<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume 38, Issue 10, 1987, Pages 831-837<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0883-2889(87)90180-8" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/0883-2889(87)90180-8</a><br/>
    <br/>
    Although in the paper two exponentials are used, for gamma-spectroscopy a single exponential
    appears to usually be sufficient, so <em>InterSpec</em> only implements a single exponential.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>GaussExp</b>: An exponential tail stitched to a Gaussian core.<br />
    See:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple alternative to the Crystal Ball function.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Souvik Das, arXiv:1603.08591<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08591" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08591</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Crystal Ball</b>: A Gaussian core portion and a power-law low-end tail, below a threshold.<br />
    See:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ball_function" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ball_function</a><br/>
    <br/>
    Uses two skew parameters.<br/>
    <ol>
      <li><b>&alpha;</b>: defines the threshold (how many gaussian sigma away from the mean for the modified-tail to start).</li>
      <li><b>n</b>: defines the power-law.
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>ExpGaussExp</b>: A double-sided version of the <em>GaussExp</em> distribution, with separate parameters for the lower and upper tails.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Double Sided Crystal Ball</b>: A double-sided version of the <em>Crystal Ball</em> distribution, with separate <b>&alpha;</b> and <b>n</b> for the lower and upper tails.
  </li>
</ul>

      <h3>Example Use Cases</h3>
      <div style="padding-top: 10px">
	  The following are typical reasons to refer to the <b>Peak Editor</b> tool.
	  </div>
	  <ul>
         <li>Fitting difficult peaks in situations where
the default peak fitting algorithm is not satisfactory, or statistics are too
low to yield a valid fit.  <ul><div>For instance, you may select for the peak centroid
and/or width to not be fit for, and instead supply the value(s) you think are
correct, and then refit the peak, thus gaining a more accurate peak area and/or
continuum estimate.</div></ul></li>
         <li>
            Add a label to the peak.
			<div><ul>For this label to also show on the chart, <u>select</u> the
&#34;Show User Labels&#34; option from the <b>View &#8594; Chart Options &#8594; Peak Labels</b>
            menu. </ul></div></li>
         <li>
            To change the continuum type.  <ul><div>By default peaks are assigned
            <b>Linear</b>
            continuums, however changing this may yield better peak fits for regions where
the continuum is more complex or a-typical.</div></ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Specifying the region of interest (ROI).  <ul><div>By default
            <i>InterSpec</i>
            guesses a ROI when fitting peaks, based on the width of the candidate peak
(derived from a polynomial smoothing of the second derivative of the data), and
a combination of features and statistical of the data - this may not result in
the optimum selection of ROI.  Specifying the ROI manually and refitting the
peak can often times increase the improved estimates of the peak.</div></ul>
         </li>
         <li>Selecting the photopeak of the nuclide responsible for creating this peak.
<ul><div>This dialog allows selecting the gamma-line from a list, rather than
typing it in like in other locations.</div></ul></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Potential Pitfalls</h3>
      <ul>
         <li style="padding-top: 10px">
            When refitting a peak, not only is the current peak the <b>Peak Editor</b> is selected for refit,
but any peaks that share its ROI are refit as well. 
<div><ul> To prevent this, you can either force the current peak to not share a ROI
by <u>right-clicking</u> on the peak and <u>selecting</u> the &#34;Own Continuum&#34; option,
or you can use the
            <b>Peak Editor</b>
            to disable fitting of the various
parameters for the other peaks.</ul></div>
         </li>
         <li style="padding-top: 10px">Many of the fields do not have error checking beyond verifying a floating point
number was entered.  For instance you could specify a ROI which does not contain
the peak centroid, resulting in the peak not even showing up on the chart.</li>
         <li style="padding-top: 10px">
            There are currently (as of 20140506) a number of options you can select that are
not fully supported: 
<ul>
<li style="padding-top: 10px">
selecting the continuum to be a globally defined continuum,
</li>
<li style="padding-top: 10px">
peak types other than Gaussian are not well supported everywhere, and we are
</li>
<li style="padding-top: 10px">
expecting to change the model of the peak skew from a Landau based scheme to be
consistent with
            <em>GADRAS</em>
</li>
</ul>
<i>
            We have left these options in the GUI because we plan to better support them, and
this way it will remind us to fix the issues (nobody said we were professionals!).</i>
         </li>
         <li style="padding-top: 10px"> There can be only one <b>Peak Editor</b> dialog open at a time; trying to open the <b>Peak Editor</b>
for a second peak will only change which peak the current dialog corresponds to.</li>
         <li style="padding-top: 10px">
            The uncertainties on the parameters initially represent the errors determined
from the fitting procedures, however, you should take them with a grain of salt.
This is for three reasons:
            <ol>
               <li style="padding-top: 10px">These values are manually editable, so may not be what the fitting
          procedure determined</li>
               <li style="padding-top: 10px">Fixing some parameters may result in much smaller uncertainties being
         derived for the other parameters, that may in fact be unreasonable.</li>
               <li style="padding-top: 10px">The uncertainties are estimated from a chi squared, or likelihood,
         function and it has not been verified that this uncertainty is what
         is actually seen during use.</li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </ul>
