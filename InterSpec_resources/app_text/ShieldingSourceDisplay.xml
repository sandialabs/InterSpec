  <message id="ssd-tt-distance">
    Distance from center of source to face of detector. Number must be
    followed by units; valid units are: meters, m, cm, mm, km, feet,
    ft, ', in, inches, or ".  You may also add multiple distances,
    such as '3ft 4in', or '3.6E-2 m 12 cm' which are equivalent to
    40inches and 15.6cm respectively.

  <message id="ssd-tt-geometry">Geometry to use for modeling "trace" sources, or self-attenuating sources.
    <br />
    <br />
    By default, all sources are point sources at the specified distance from the detector, for all geometries.
    <br />
    However, if you make a nuclide a "trace" source (by clicking on a shielding's ⊕ button
    and selecting "<em>Add Trace Source</em>"), or a self-attenuating source (by selecting the
    <em>Source for:</em>" checkbox when a shielding has the same element as a nuclide you are
    fitting), then the source isotope will be modeled as distributed throughout the shielding,
    and ray-tracing will be used to account for different attenuations at each location within
    the shielding.
    <br />
    <br />
    To keep things simple, choose "Point/Spherical" geometry unless you will perform a fit to a
    "trace" or self-attenuating source.
