    The number of FWHM, from the peak mean, to include source gammas from as contributing to a peaks area.
    <br />
    For some photopeaks of some nuclides multiple gammas that are close in energy may contribute
    to creating a detected peak area.  This match tolerance specifies how many FWHM from the
    observed peak mean source gammas should be summed to determine the branching ratio to use.
    <br />
    Specifying a value of zero will will cause only the gamma energy assigned to a peak to
    be used, even if there are very nearby other gammas.

    An additional uncertainty to add to the relative efficiency line, for each fit photopeak.
    <br />
    Small deviations in efficiency of detection for one or a few high statistics peaks can cause the
    efficiency curve to notably deviate from the other points if only statical uncertainties are
    used; when an additional uncertainty is added the relative efficiency will then do a better job
    of visibly going through all the data points, and from limited testing produce more accurate
    results.  You can think of this as adding a systematic uncertainty to each detected photopeak,
    that is uncorrelated between peaks.  From limited testing the value used is not hugely
    important, just as long as there is something.  You can also choose to use an unweighted fit,
    where each peak will contribute to the fit equally, no matter its statistical uncertainty.
